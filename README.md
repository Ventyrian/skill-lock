# Skill Lock Plugin
This is my first plugin, and it was designed for use with snowflake accounts that impose self restrictions to their skills or maximum skill level. I took inspiration from SlayerScape, and many other unqiue ironman accounts. I hope to use this plugin myself after I finish my TaskLocked ruleset and maybe make a plugin for that. 
## Main Features
#### NOTE ALL FEATURES ARE PURELY COSMETIC AND DO NOT CHANGE THE ACTUAL VALUES OF YOUR SKILLS OR EXP
- Ability to grey out skills and have them "locked"  (right click option: on / off, Will overlay lock icon and grey out skill)
- Ability to lock skills to a certain static level (right click option: input level, Will overwrite skill guide values with the input value)
- Ability to preview real level (hovering over static skill and holding shift will reveal actual skill level)
- In addition to all in-game context menus the plugin has all controls in its config panel as well, if you want to quickly change various settings
