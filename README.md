# Skill Lock Plugin
This is my first plugin, and it was designed for use with snowflake accounts that impose self restrictions to their skills or maximum skill level. I took inspiration from SlayerScape, and many other unqiue ironman accounts. I hope to use this plugin myself after I finish my TaskLocked ruleset and maybe make a plugin for that. 
## Using Skill Lock
Firstly, download the Skill Lock plugin from the Runelite Plugin Hub.
You should then see Skill Lock in the plugin configuration list. (You can search skill to filter the list)
Below is an example of navigating the configuration menu:

You can also set these values in game using the context menus from the skills as demonstrated below (Note holding SHIFT while hovering a static skill will reveal the actual level):

## Main Features
#### NOTE ALL FEATURES ARE PURELY COSMETIC AND DO NOT CHANGE THE ACTUAL VALUES OF YOUR SKILLS OR EXP
- Ability to grey out skills and have them "locked"  (right click option: on / off, Will overlay lock icon and grey out skill)
- Ability to lock skills to a certain static level (right click option: input level, Will overwrite skill guide values with the input value)
- Ability to preview real level (hovering over static skill and holding shift will reveal actual skill level)
- In addition to all in-game context menus the plugin has all controls in its config panel as well, if you want to quickly change various settings
- Differentiates between f2p and members when showing tooltips

## Future Work
- Fix tooltips for higher level skills
- Maybe add animation and sound effects for when unlocking skills
